Meater is an Android app that measures your meat consumption over a week (for the moment !). With Meater, you can know now how many times you eat meat and then try to reduce your quantity of it. This can be helpfull for people who try to be vegetarian, for lovers of animals or for those who want to reduce their impact on the Earth.

# Motivation

After looking a video of [@Absol](https://twitter.com/Absol_Videos) about the animal abuse (that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s6qXfbHpLo)), I wanted to know if my consumption of meat was correct from what i wanted to eat. My goal wasn't to become vegetarian, but to consume best meat fewer times. To reach this goal, I started to maintain a spreadsheet. It was too tedious, so I made an app for it !

# Installation

Import the project on Android Studio to run in on your phone. When the first draft will be finished, I'll post an APK.
